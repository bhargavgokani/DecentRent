Problem Statement : The current house renting market is plagued with numerous inefficiencies and challenges, including high transaction fees,
                    lack of transparency, fraud, and lengthy verification processes. These issues often lead to distrust between landlords and
                    tenants, making the renting process cumbersome and stressful.
                    A decentralized house renting platform aims to address these problems by leveraging blockchain technology to create a more
                    efficient, secure, and transparent system. The platform would provide a peer-to-peer marketplace where landlords and tenants
                    can interact directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
