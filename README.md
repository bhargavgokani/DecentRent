Problem Statement: The current house renting market is plagued with numerous inefficiencies and challenges, including high transaction fees,
                    lack of transparency, fraud, and lengthy verification processes. These issues often lead to distrust between landlords and
                    tenants, making the renting process cumbersome and stressful.
                    A decentralized house-renting platform aims to address these problems by leveraging blockchain technology to create a more
                    efficient, secure, and transparent system. The platform would provide a peer-to-peer marketplace where landlords and tenants
                    can interact directly, eliminating the need for intermediaries.

Probable Solution: To create an effective decentralized house-renting platform, we need to implement several key components and leverage various
                    technologies like blockchain and smart contracts. We have intended to provide a user-friendly interface that supports transparent
                    payment services and security measures. This decentralized house-renting platform aims to revolutionize the rental market by providing
                    a secure, transparent, and efficient alternative to traditional renting processes. By leveraging blockchain technology, smart contracts,
                    and decentralized identity verification, the platform can address current challenges and build a trustworthy ecosystem for landlords and tenants.
